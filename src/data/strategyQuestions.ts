        ],
        answer: "A momentum strategy buys assets that have performed well recently and sells those that have underperformed, based on the principle that trends tend to persist. It exploits behavioral biases like herding, anchoring, and delayed overreaction. Momentum works across different timeframes: short-term (1-3 months) captures earnings surprises, while long-term (6-12 months) captures fundamental trends. Unlike trend-following which uses technical indicators, momentum is fundamentally about relative performance and can be applied to any asset class.",

        answer: "Momentum excels in trending markets with low volatility, where information diffuses slowly and behavioral biases persist. It works best during economic expansions when fundamentals drive sustained moves, and in low-volatility regimes where trends aren't interrupted by sharp reversals. Momentum also performs well during market recoveries (2009-2010) and in sectors with strong earnings growth. It struggles in high-volatility, choppy markets (2008, 2020 Q1) where reversals are frequent, and during regime changes when past winners become future losers.",

        ],
        answer: "Momentum breaks down during sharp market reversals, regime changes, and high-stress periods. Behavioral reasons: overextended positions lead to violent mean reversion when sentiment shifts. Momentum crashes occur when past winners become crowded trades that unwind simultaneously. Examples: March 2009 (momentum stocks crashed 40%+), March 2020 (growth momentum collapsed), and late-cycle reversals when leadership rotates. Momentum is highly correlated with market stress - during crises, all momentum strategies fail together as correlations spike to 1.",

        answer: "Crowding occurs when too many investors hold the same momentum positions, creating vulnerability to sudden reversals. When momentum trades become crowded, they exhibit lower expected returns and higher tail risk. Signals of overcrowding include: high ownership concentration, low short interest, extreme valuations, and high correlation among momentum stocks. To manage: diversify across momentum factors, monitor positioning data, reduce size in crowded names, and use stop-losses.

        answer: "Volatility and momentum have an inverse relationship: momentum works best in low-volatility environments where trends persist, and breaks down in high-volatility regimes where reversals are frequent. Low vol allows trends to develop and continue, while high vol creates noise that interrupts momentum. Position sizing should be volatility-adjusted: reduce size when vol spikes, increase when vol normalizes. Volatility-adjusted momentum signals (dividing returns by volatility) can improve risk-adjusted performance by filtering out noise.",

        answer: "Earnings seasons create both opportunities and risks for momentum. Pre-earnings: momentum can continue as expectations build, but risk increases as positions become crowded. Post-earnings: positive surprises can accelerate momentum (earnings momentum effect), while negative surprises cause sharp reversals. The post-earnings announcement drift (PEAD) shows momentum continues after positive surprises for 3-6 months. Risk management: reduce position sizes before earnings, use options for protection, or avoid earnings periods entirely.

Reduce exposure when: volatility spikes, correlations increase, or regime shifts. Maintain exposure during normal drawdowns if fundamentals unchanged.

Adjustments: (1) Reduce position sizes, (2) Shift to defensive momentum (low vol, quality), (3) Increase stop-losses, (4) Reduce leverage, (5) Consider exiting entirely.
