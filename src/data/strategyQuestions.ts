        ],
        answer: "A momentum strategy buys assets that have performed well recently and sells those that have underperformed, based on the principle that trends tend to persist. It exploits behavioral biases like herding, anchoring, and delayed overreaction. Momentum works across different timeframes: short-term (1-3 months) captures earnings surprises, while long-term (6-12 months) captures fundamental trends. Unlike trend-following which uses technical indicators, momentum is fundamentally about relative performance and can be applied to any asset class.",

        answer: "Momentum excels in trending markets with low volatility, where information diffuses slowly and behavioral biases persist. It works best during economic expansions when fundamentals drive sustained moves, and in low-volatility regimes where trends aren't interrupted by sharp reversals. Momentum also performs well during market recoveries (2009-2010) and in sectors with strong earnings growth. It struggles in high-volatility, choppy markets (2008, 2020 Q1) where reversals are frequent, and during regime changes when past winners become future losers.",

        ],
        answer: "Momentum breaks down during sharp market reversals, regime changes, and high-stress periods. Behavioral reasons: overextended positions lead to violent mean reversion when sentiment shifts. Momentum crashes occur when past winners become crowded trades that unwind simultaneously. Examples: March 2009 (momentum stocks crashed 40%+), March 2020 (growth momentum collapsed), and late-cycle reversals when leadership rotates. Momentum is highly correlated with market stress - during crises, all momentum strategies fail together as correlations spike to 1.",

        answer: "Crowding occurs when too many investors hold the same momentum positions, creating vulnerability to sudden reversals. When momentum trades become crowded, they exhibit lower expected returns and higher tail risk. Signals of overcrowding include: high ownership concentration, low short interest, extreme valuations, and high correlation among momentum stocks. To manage: diversify across momentum factors, monitor positioning data, reduce size in crowded names, and use stop-losses.

        answer: "Volatility and momentum have an inverse relationship: momentum works best in low-volatility environments where trends persist, and breaks down in high-volatility regimes where reversals are frequent. Low vol allows trends to develop and continue, while high vol creates noise that interrupts momentum. Position sizing should be volatility-adjusted: reduce size when vol spikes, increase when vol normalizes. Volatility-adjusted momentum signals (dividing returns by volatility) can improve risk-adjusted performance by filtering out noise.",

        answer: "Earnings seasons create both opportunities and risks for momentum. Pre-earnings: momentum can continue as expectations build, but risk increases as positions become crowded. Post-earnings: positive surprises can accelerate momentum (earnings momentum effect), while negative surprises cause sharp reversals. The post-earnings announcement drift (PEAD) shows momentum continues after positive surprises for 3-6 months. Risk management: reduce position sizes before earnings, use options for protection, or avoid earnings periods entirely.

Reduce exposure when: volatility spikes, correlations increase, or regime shifts. Maintain exposure during normal drawdowns if fundamentals unchanged.

        answer: "Dispersion is considered structural because the vol spread persists due to market structure, not temporary mispricing. Structural reasons: index options are more liquid (easier to source), investors demand index protection (creating supply), single-stock vol is harder to source (creating premium), and diversification is real (low correlation is normal). Unlike arbitrage which closes quickly, dispersion persists because it's not risk-free - it has correlation risk. The edge exists because most investors can't or won't take the correlation risk. This makes it a sustainable trade, not a one-time arbitrage.",

        answer: "Investors abandon tail hedges because: cost drag (hedges cost money regularly, hurting performance), complacency (no crashes for years, hedges seem unnecessary), performance pressure (clients question why they're paying for unused protection), and behavioral bias (recency bias - 'crashes won't happen again'). The cost feels like wasted money when markets are calm. However, abandoning hedges right before crashes is common - investors give up just when protection is needed most. This is why tail hedging requires discipline and long-term thinking. The cost is insurance premium - you pay hoping you never need it.",

Latency is critical: milliseconds matter, slow execution = missed opportunities or worse prices. Suspension risk: markets close during goals/cards, you're stuck in positions.

        answer: "A surebet (arbitrage bet) is a situation where you can bet on all possible outcomes of an event across different bookmakers and guarantee a profit regardless of the result. It exists when: bookmakers price the same event differently (one offers better odds on team A, another on team B), the combined implied probability is less than 100% (creating guaranteed profit), and you can place all bets simultaneously. Why it exists: bookmakers have different models/opinions, want to balance books differently, or make pricing errors. However, surebets are rare and short-lived because: bookmakers adjust quickly (odds change when money comes in), competition is fierce (other arbitrageurs spot them), and execution is difficult (need multiple accounts, fast execution). The key: surebets exist due to market inefficiency, but are quickly eliminated.",

        answer: "Pure arbitrage is rare and short-lived because: competition is intense (many arbitrageurs scanning markets, fastest wins), bookmakers adjust quickly (odds change when money comes in, closing the opportunity), execution is difficult (need multiple accounts, fast execution, capital), and markets are mostly efficient (bookmakers are sophisticated, pricing errors are rare). Speed matters: opportunities last seconds/minutes, not hours. Competition: when one arbitrageur spots it, others follow, odds adjust, opportunity closes. Additionally: bookmakers limit winning accounts (restrict or ban arbitrageurs), making it harder to exploit.

        answer: "Even 'risk-free' arbitrage has execution risks: odds change (you bet one side, odds move before you bet the other - opportunity disappears), partial fills (you get part of your bet, rest at worse price - breaks arbitrage), account restrictions (bookmaker limits your bet size - can't complete arbitrage), and timing (one bookmaker processes faster, you're exposed until other processes). Additionally: connection issues (internet problems during execution), bookmaker errors (they void bets, change odds), and settlement risk (one bookmaker doesn't pay).

        answer: "Limits and restrictions severely impact arbitrage: bet limits (bookmakers cap bet sizes - you can't bet enough to make arbitrage meaningful), account restrictions (winning accounts get limited or banned - can't continue arbitraging), and withdrawal limits (can't withdraw profits quickly - capital tied up). Impact: prevents scaling (can't increase size as you find more opportunities), reduces profitability (small bets = small profits), and creates operational risk (lose accounts, can't execute). Workarounds: multiple accounts (spread risk, but expensive to maintain), family/friends accounts (use others' accounts, but risky), and accept limits (work within constraints).

        answer: "Odds discrepancies arise from: different models (bookmakers use different statistical models, leading to different opinions), book balancing (bookmakers want balanced books, may shade odds differently), market structure (some bookmakers focus on different markets/regions), and pricing errors (mistakes happen, especially on less popular events). Persistence: discrepancies persist longer on: less popular events (less attention, slower adjustment), smaller bookmakers (less sophisticated, slower to adjust), and regional differences (different markets, different pricing). Exploitation: scan multiple bookmakers, identify discrepancies, calculate if arbitrage exists, execute quickly.

        answer: "Latency risk is the delay between identifying an arbitrage opportunity and executing bets - during this delay, odds can change, closing the opportunity. Impact: high latency = miss opportunities (odds move before you bet), get worse prices (odds change against you), or partial execution (only part of arbitrage completes). Competition: fastest arbitrageurs win (low latency = first to execute), others lose (high latency = opportunity gone). Mitigation: fast internet (low latency connection), co-location (servers near bookmakers), automation (systems execute faster than humans), and pre-positioning (have accounts ready, funds deposited).

Solutions: accept limits (work within constraints), focus on quality over quantity (better opportunities, not more), and automate operations (reduce overhead).
