        answer: "A momentum strategy buys assets that have performed well recently and sells those that have underperformed, based on the principle that trends tend to persist. It exploits behavioral biases like herding, anchoring, and delayed overreaction. Momentum works across different timeframes: short-term (1-3 months) captures earnings surprises, while long-term (6-12 months) captures fundamental trends. Unlike trend-following which uses technical indicators, momentum is fundamentally about relative performance and can be applied to any asset class.",

It works best during economic expansions when fundamentals drive sustained moves, and in low-volatility regimes where trends aren't interrupted by sharp reversals. Momentum also performs well during market recoveries (2009-2010) and in sectors with strong earnings growth. It struggles in high-volatility, choppy markets (2008, 2020 Q1) where reversals are frequent, and during regime changes when past winners become future losers.",

        answer: "Crowding occurs when too many investors hold the same momentum positions, creating vulnerability to sudden reversals. When momentum trades become crowded, they exhibit lower expected returns and higher tail risk. Signals of overcrowding include: high ownership concentration, low short interest, extreme valuations, and high correlation among momentum stocks.

        answer: "Volatility and momentum have an inverse relationship: momentum works best in low-volatility environments where trends persist, and breaks down in high-volatility regimes where reversals are frequent. Low vol allows trends to develop and continue, while high vol creates noise that interrupts momentum. Position sizing should be volatility-adjusted: reduce size when vol spikes, increase when vol normalizes.

        answer: "Earnings seasons create both opportunities and risks for momentum. Pre-earnings: momentum can continue as expectations build, but risk increases as positions become crowded. Post-earnings: positive surprises can accelerate momentum (earnings momentum effect), while negative surprises cause sharp reversals. The post-earnings announcement drift (PEAD) shows momentum continues after positive surprises for 3-6 months. Risk management: reduce position sizes before earnings, use options for protection, or avoid earnings periods entirely.

Reduce exposure when: volatility spikes, correlations increase, or regime shifts. Maintain exposure during normal drawdowns if fundamentals unchanged.

Growth stocks act like bonds when: (1) Most value is in distant cash flows (5-10+ years out), (2) Current earnings are low relative to future expectations, (3) High P/E ratios reflect future growth, not current earnings. Interest rate sensitivity: when rates rise, the present value of distant cash flows falls sharply.

Margin expansion importance: (1) Operating leverage - fixed costs spread over more revenue, (2) Pricing power - ability to raise prices, (3) Efficiency gains - cost reductions. Quality of growth: profitable growth (expanding margins) is sustainable, unprofitable growth (burning cash) is not.

The strategy: buy stocks with high, sustainable dividends. Yield is important, but dividend growth and sustainability matter more. The key: income strategies balance yield with sustainability - high yield without sustainability is a trap.",

        answer: "High yield signals risk when: (1) Dividend unsustainable - yield >8-10% often indicates dividend cut risk, (2) Price decline - high yield from falling price, not rising dividend, (3) Business distress - company struggling, dividend at risk, (4) Sector stress - entire sector under pressure (energy 2020). Yield trap: high yield that gets cut, causing capital loss. Identification: check payout ratio (>80% is risky), earnings coverage, debt levels, sector health.

Consider how this differs from a long-only approach.", answer: "A long/short equity strategy involves taking long positions in stocks expected to outperform and short positions in stocks expected to underperform. The goal is to generate alpha on both sides of the portfolio while potentially maintaining market neutrality. Unlike long-only strategies, long/short can profit from both rising and falling markets. Key characteristics include: the ability to generate returns independent of market direction, potential for higher risk-adjusted returns, and the ability to express negative views through shorting. However, it also involves short-selling risks, higher costs (borrow fees), and the complexity of managing both long and short books simultaneously." },

Gross exposure is long plus short. Think about how each affects market sensitivity and risk.", answer: "Net exposure = Long exposure - Short exposure. It measures directional market sensitivity. A net exposure of 50% means the portfolio behaves like 50% long the market. Gross exposure = Long exposure + Short exposure. It measures total capital at risk. A gross exposure of 150% (100% long, 50% short) means 150% of capital is invested. Key differences: net exposure drives market sensitivity (high net = directional), gross exposure drives total risk (high gross = more positions, more risk).

Think about what causes this and how to manage the risk.", answer: "Short squeezes occur when heavily shorted stocks rise rapidly, forcing short sellers to buy back shares, which drives prices even higher. Impact: can cause significant losses on short positions, especially if positions are large relative to float. Causes: positive news, low float (few shares available), high short interest, or coordinated buying. Risk management: (1) Position sizing - limit short size relative to float, (2) Monitor short interest - avoid stocks with very high short interest, (3) Use stop-losses - exit shorts if they move against you, (4) Diversify shorts - don't concentrate in squeeze-prone stocks, (5) Understand catalysts - know what could trigger a squeeze.

Risk management: focus on liquid, easily borrowable stocks for shorts, monitor borrow costs, maintain relationships with prime brokers, and have exit plans for hard-to-borrow situations.

Considerations: cost (futures are cheaper than ETFs), effectiveness (futures track better), and basis risk (hedge may not perfectly match portfolio).

This matters because: it changes risk profile (becomes market-dependent), reduces diversification benefits, and may not match client expectations (they may want market-neutral).

Key messages: drawdowns are part of the strategy (not bugs, but features), risk management is active (not passive), and long-term track record matters more than short-term performance.

Consider how long and short positions can offset each other.", answer: "Market neutral strategies aim to eliminate market risk (beta) while generating alpha from stock selection. Key characteristics: (1) Beta neutral - long and short positions offset market exposure, (2) Alpha focus - returns come from stock-picking, not market direction, (3) Risk characteristics - lower volatility, market-independent returns. The strategy: long undervalued stocks, short overvalued stocks, maintaining net market exposure near zero. Returns are typically lower but more consistent than directional strategies. The key: market neutral = alpha without beta - returns independent of market direction." },

Think about factor exposures, sector concentration, and other non-market risks.", answer: "Risks despite neutrality: (1) Factor risk - exposure to style factors (value, growth, momentum), (2) Sector risk - concentration in certain sectors, (3) Liquidity risk - positions may be illiquid, (4) Model risk - risk models may be wrong, (5) Correlation risk - correlations can break down in stress. These risks remain because neutrality only eliminates market risk (beta), not other risks. The key: market neutral eliminates market risk but not factor, sector, or liquidity risk - these must be managed separately." },

Think about how this affects market-neutral strategies.", answer: "Factor correlations affect neutrality: (1) Correlation breakdown - factors that were uncorrelated become correlated in stress, (2) Factor exposure - long/short books may have different factor exposures, creating risk, (3) Risk monitoring - need to monitor factor exposures continuously, (4) Neutralization - neutralize factor exposures to maintain true neutrality. Impact: when correlations break, factor exposures can create directional risk even if market beta is neutral. The key: factor correlations are not stable - need to monitor and neutralize factor exposures to maintain neutrality." },

Impact: market neutral strategies often use leverage (2-5x) to boost low returns, but this amplifies all risks (factor, sector, liquidity). Risk management: (1) Limit leverage - don't over-leverage, (2) Monitor risk - leverage amplifies all risks, not just returns, (3) Position sizing - size positions based on risk, not just expected return. The key: leverage is a double-edged sword - amplifies returns but also risks." },

Historical: 2008 (correlation breakdown), 2020 Q1 (liquidity crisis), LTCM 1998 (model failure). The key: neutral strategies work until they don't - stress periods expose hidden risks and cause breakdowns." },

Impact: funding costs can consume 20-50% of gross returns in market neutral strategies. During stress, funding costs spike, making strategies unprofitable. The key: funding costs are a drag on returns - need to generate enough alpha to cover funding costs and still profit." },

True neutrality: beta = 0, factor exposures = 0, sector neutral, style neutral. The key: true neutrality requires neutralizing all exposures, not just market beta - need comprehensive risk monitoring." },

Think about why this happens.", answer: "Returns are low but volatile because: (1) Low returns - no market beta exposure, returns come only from alpha (typically 5-10% annually), (2) Volatility sources - factor risk, sector risk, correlation breakdown create volatility, (3) Risk-return trade-off - lower returns but also lower risk (than directional), (4) Client expectations - clients expect low volatility but often get volatility from factor/sector risk. The key: market neutral reduces market risk but not other risks - returns are lower but volatility can still be significant from non-market risks." },

Conditions: works best in normal markets with low correlations. Less attractive in stress (correlations break) or strong trends (missing upside). The key: market neutral is attractive when you want returns independent of market direction, but requires favorable correlation environment." },

Consider the risks and time horizon.", answer: "Merger arbitrage profits from the spread between a target's current price and the deal price. Strategy: buy target stock after deal announcement, hold until deal closes, profit from spread. Deal spread: difference between current price and deal price (typically 2-5%). Risk-return: low risk if deal completes, high risk if deal breaks. Time horizon: typically 3-6 months until deal closes. The key: merger arb is about trading deal spreads - profit if deal completes, lose if deal breaks." },

Think about what causes spreads to widen or narrow: regulatory issues, financing problems, market conditions.", answer: "Deal spread volatility depends on: (1) Deal characteristics - cash deals are less volatile than stock deals, (2) Market conditions - spreads widen in market stress, (3) Regulatory risk - antitrust concerns widen spreads, (4) Financing risk - credit market stress widens spreads. Spreads widen when: regulatory issues arise, financing becomes difficult, market crashes. Spreads narrow when: regulatory approval likely, financing secured, deal near completion.

Think about the antitrust process and how to assess and manage regulatory risk.", answer: "Regulatory risks evolve: (1) Antitrust process - DOJ/FTC review can take 6-12 months, (2) Timeline - risk highest early, decreases as approval likely, (3) Risk assessment - analyze market concentration, competitive impact, (4) Position management - reduce size if regulatory risk high, increase if approval likely. Evolution: initial uncertainty → review period → approval/rejection decision. The key: regulatory risk is highest early, decreases over time - manage positions accordingly." },

Historical: 2008, 2020 Q1 saw widespread spread widening and deal breaks. The key: market crashes are dangerous for merger arb - spreads widen, deals break, liquidity disappears." },

Think about spreading across multiple deals, sectors, and deal types to reduce risk.", answer: "Diversify by: (1) Multiple deals - hold 10-20 deals, not 1-2, (2) Sector diversification - spread across sectors (tech, healthcare, industrials), (3) Geographic diversification - US, Europe, Asia deals, (4) Deal type - mix cash and stock deals. Benefits: reduces impact of single deal break, reduces correlation risk. The key: diversification is essential - single deal breaks can cause large losses, multiple deals reduce risk." },

Accommodative policy (QE, low rates) suppresses volatility by providing liquidity, supporting asset prices, and reducing uncertainty. This creates short vol regimes. Tightening policy (rate hikes, QT) increases volatility by removing liquidity, pressuring asset prices, and increasing uncertainty. Forward guidance also matters - clear communication reduces vol, while uncertainty increases it. The transmission works through: liquidity provision/withdrawal, asset price support/pressure, and confidence effects. However, policy can't control vol forever - eventually fundamentals matter more.",

Market makers, facing increased risk, widen spreads and charge more for puts. The feedback loop: falling markets → fear → put buying → higher put vol → steeper skew → more fear.

Impact: if you're a market maker providing liquidity, rebates can be 50-100% of your spread - crucial for profitability. Without rebates: market making may be unprofitable (spread too small to cover fees). Optimization: focus on markets with good rebates, maximize maker volume (provide liquidity, don't take), and understand fee structure (maker vs taker matters).

Underpriced: markets assume quiet match, but events happen (goals, cards) - actual vol > implied vol. Overpriced: markets assume volatile match, but it's quiet - actual vol < implied vol. Exploitation: if you think volatility is mispriced, position accordingly (long vol if underpriced, short vol if overpriced).

Limitations: assumes known probabilities (you don't know true probabilities), ignores variance (Kelly maximizes growth but high variance), and can be aggressive (full Kelly = high risk of large drawdowns). Fractional Kelly: bet f* / k (e.g., half Kelly = f* / 2) - reduces risk while maintaining most of growth. Sports application: estimate win probability, calculate Kelly, use fractional Kelly (typically 0.25-0.5 Kelly) for safety. The key: Kelly optimizes growth but is aggressive - fractional Kelly balances growth and risk.",

        answer: "Positive-EV strategies can go bankrupt due to: variance (even with edge, losing streaks happen - variance can wipe you out before edge compounds), poor sizing (betting too much - one bad streak destroys bankroll), and sequence risk (order of wins/losses matters - early losses force position reduction, preventing recovery). Example: 55% win rate, even odds, but betting 30% of bankroll - high probability of ruin despite positive EV. The problem: variance creates drawdowns, and if drawdowns exceed bankroll, you're ruined. Mitigation: proper sizing (Kelly or fractional Kelly - limits bet size), bankroll management (never bet more than you can afford to lose), and accept variance (edge works long-term, but short-term variance can be brutal). The key: positive EV doesn't guarantee survival - need proper sizing and bankroll management to survive variance.",

        answer: "Manage drawdowns psychologically by: accepting variance (drawdowns are normal - even with edge, losing streaks happen), maintaining discipline (stick to strategy, don't chase losses - tilt causes bad decisions), setting expectations (know that drawdowns will occur - prepare mentally), and taking breaks (if stressed, step away - clear mind, avoid tilt). Tilt: emotional trading after losses - chasing losses, overbetting, abandoning strategy. Prevention: recognize tilt (awareness is first step), have rules (stop-losses, position limits - force discipline), and maintain perspective (short-term variance, long-term edge). Recovery: trust the process (if strategy has edge, it will recover), don't change strategy during drawdowns (stick to plan), and be patient (edge works over time, not immediately).

Methods: set max bet size (e.g., 5% of bankroll max - limits single bet loss), set max match exposure (e.g., 10% of bankroll per match - limits match-specific risk), and use correlated hedges (bet opposite outcomes - reduce tail risk). Event-driven: tail risk is high (events cause large moves - goals, cards), so limits are crucial.

Adaptation: size based on available liquidity (don't bet more than market allows), use multiple markets (spread bets across markets - increase capacity), and accept constraints (work within limits, don't force sizing).
