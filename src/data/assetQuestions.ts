            question: 'What are the main drivers of government bond yields across maturities?',
            answer: 'Short-term yields are driven primarily by central bank policy rates and expectations. Long-term yields reflect inflation expectations, growth prospects, term premium, and supply/demand dynamics.

            answer: 'Long-end yields can rise during rate cuts if: inflation expectations increase, growth expectations improve, fiscal policy becomes more expansionary (more supply), term premium increases, or foreign demand weakens.

            question: 'How does quantitative tightening affect government bond markets?',
            answer: 'QT (selling bonds or letting them mature) increases bond supply in the market, putting upward pressure on yields. It reduces central bank balance sheet, tightens financial conditions, and can steepen the yield curve. Opposite effect of QE (quantitative easing).',

            answer: 'An auction "tails" when the stop-out yield is higher than the pre-auction market yield, indicating weak demand. Causes: oversupply relative to demand, poor market conditions, unexpected auction size, or dealer inventory constraints. Tails signal market stress or mispricing.',

            answer: 'A steepening curve (long rates rising faster than short rates) typically signals: improving growth expectations, rising inflation expectations, or expectations of future rate hikes. Can also reflect increased term premium or supply concerns at the long end.',

            answer: 'In risk-off (flight to quality), government bonds rally (yields fall) as investors seek safe havens. High-quality sovereigns (US, Germany, Japan) benefit most. Safe-haven flows compress yields, flatten curves, and reduce credit spreads. Bonds act as portfolio hedge.',

            question: 'Why might two countries with similar inflation have very different yields?',
            answer: 'Differences can arise from: credit risk (default probability), currency risk, political stability, fiscal position (debt/GDP), central bank credibility, capital controls, liquidity, and foreign demand. Even with similar inflation, risk premiums vary significantly.',

            question: 'How do duration and convexity differ across the curve?',
            answer: 'Duration (price sensitivity to yield changes) increases with maturity - longer bonds more sensitive. Convexity (rate of change of duration) also increases with maturity and is higher for lower-coupon bonds. Long-end has higher duration and convexity, making it more volatile.',

            answer: 'Fiscal deficits: increase government borrowing (more supply), raise default risk concerns, and increase term premium. Larger deficits = more bond supply = higher yields.

            question: 'Why can yield curves invert before recessions?',
            answer: 'Curves invert because: markets anticipate rate cuts (short-end falls), long-end reflects recession expectations (lower growth, lower inflation), and term premium compresses.
