            answer: 'Short-term yields are driven primarily by central bank policy rates and expectations. Long-term yields reflect inflation expectations, growth prospects, term premium, and supply/demand dynamics.

            answer: 'Long-end yields can rise during rate cuts if: inflation expectations increase, growth expectations improve, fiscal policy becomes more expansionary (more supply), term premium increases, or foreign demand weakens.

            question: 'How does quantitative tightening affect government bond markets?',
            answer: 'QT (selling bonds or letting them mature) increases bond supply in the market, putting upward pressure on yields. It reduces central bank balance sheet, tightens financial conditions, and can steepen the yield curve. Opposite effect of QE (quantitative easing).',

            answer: 'An auction "tails" when the stop-out yield is higher than the pre-auction market yield, indicating weak demand. Causes: oversupply relative to demand, poor market conditions, unexpected auction size, or dealer inventory constraints. Tails signal market stress or mispricing.',

            answer: 'A steepening curve (long rates rising faster than short rates) typically signals: improving growth expectations, rising inflation expectations, or expectations of future rate hikes. Can also reflect increased term premium or supply concerns at the long end.',

            question: 'How do duration and convexity differ across the curve?',
            answer: 'Duration (price sensitivity to yield changes) increases with maturity - longer bonds more sensitive. Convexity (rate of change of duration) also increases with maturity and is higher for lower-coupon bonds. Long-end has higher duration and convexity, making it more volatile.',

            answer: 'Spreads are determined by: credit risk (default probability, recovery rate), liquidity risk, sector-specific factors, market sentiment, supply/demand dynamics, and technical factors.

            answer: 'Spreads can widen due to: market-wide risk-off sentiment, sector contagion, liquidity crises, forced selling (fund redemptions), rating agency actions, regulatory changes, or technical factors (supply/demand imbalances).

            question: 'What drives intraday stock price movements?',
            answer: 'Intraday moves are driven by: news/earnings releases, order flow imbalances (buy/sell pressure), algorithmic trading, market maker inventory, technical levels (support/resistance), and sentiment.

            question: 'How do liquidity conditions affect execution costs?',
            answer: 'Low liquidity (low volume, wide spreads) increases execution costs through: wider bid-ask spreads, market impact (large orders move prices), and timing risk. High liquidity reduces costs. Execution costs = spread + market impact + timing cost. Liquidity varies by stock, time of day, and market conditions.',

            question: 'Why do stocks sometimes fall on good earnings?',
            answer: 'Stocks can fall on good earnings if: earnings beat expectations but guidance is weak, margins compress, growth slows, or valuation was too high. "Buy the rumor, sell the news" - stocks may have rallied in anticipation. Market reaction depends on expectations vs reality.',

            answer: 'High short interest: can create short squeezes (if stock rises, shorts cover, pushing price higher), indicates bearish sentiment, and can limit upside (shorts provide supply).

            answer: 'During sell-offs, correlations rise because: risk-off sentiment affects all stocks, forced selling (margin calls, redemptions) hits all positions, and diversification fails.

            answer: 'Macro data (GDP, inflation, employment) affects indices broadly (all stocks move together) but single names react to company-specific factors.
